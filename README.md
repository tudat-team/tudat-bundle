# tudat-bundle

This repository facililates parallel development of `tudat` and `tudatpy` by allowing you to easily download the two libraries, building them from source, and installing them in your Conda environment.

> [!NOTE]
> If you just want to use the default version of `tudat` and `tudatpy`, we recommend installing our [conda packages](https://anaconda.org/tudat-team/repo)

For developer documentation, check the [tudat](https://github.com/tudat-team/tudat/wiki) and [tudatpy](https://github.com/tudat-team/tudatpy/wiki) wikis. For more details about the project, check our [website](https://docs.tudat.space/en/latest/), and our [Github page](https://github.com/tudat-team).

## Contents of `tudat-bundle`

The `tudat-bundle` repository contains the following items:
- `tudat`: The C++ source code of the library.
- `tudatpy`: The source code of the Python interface for the library.
- `build.py`: Build tudat and tudatpy from source.
- `install.py`: Install tudat and tudatpy in your Conda environment.
- `uninstall.py`: Remove tudat and tudatpy from your conda environment.
- `environment.yaml`: The file from which you can create your conda environment.

The remaiming files and directories are for configuration purposes.

<!-- The `tudat-bundle` comprises the following repositories:
- `tudat`, where the tudat source code is located (this is a separate git repository);
- `tudatpy`, where the tudatpy binding code is located (this is a separate git repository); -->
<!-- - `cli`, where the Python Command Line Interface scripts to build the API are located; -->
<!--
In addition, once the project is built, all the build output will be dumped in the `cmake-build-debug` directory, which
is not tracked by Git. If the API is also built, more untracked directories will appear, but this is explained in the
`tudat-multidoc/README.md` file. -->

## Prerequisites

> [!NOTE]
> **For windows users only**
> The steps in this guide assume the use of Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Have a look at the [Setting up WSL for tudat development](#setting-up-wsl-for-tudat-development) section before proceeding with the next steps.

- Conda: How to install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
- CMake: You can run `conda install cmake` on your terminal.
- Git: You can run `conda install git` on your terminal.

<!-- Do the conda install options work? -->

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and enter directory

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tudat-team/tudat-bundle
cd tudat-bundle
```

2. Clone the `tudat` and `tudatpy` submodules

```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

3. Switch `tudat` and `tudatpy` to the develop branch

```shell
cd tudat
git checkout develop
cd ../tudatpy
git checkout develop
cd ..
```
You don't necessarily have to use the `develop` branches, but we recommend it, as they receive frequent updates, and are the ones used to build the Conda packages.

4. Create a conda environment with required dependencies

The file `environment.yaml` specifies all the dependencies you will need to work with `tudat` and `tudatpy`

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate tudat-bundle
```
> [!NOTE]
> It is possible that the creation of the environment will "time out". A likely reason for this is that some packages cannot be found by the current channel: `conda-forge`. It is then advisable to add the channel `anaconda` to the "channels" list in `environment.yaml` to ensure a proper creation of the environment.

There are several directions you can follow from here. Our recommendation is to use the `build.py` and `install.py` scripts to compile and install the library, as explained below. Have a look at [Alternative build: CLion](#alternative-build-clion), or [Alternative build: VSCode](#alternative-build-vscode) if you prefer to use those tools instead.

5. Compile Tudat and TudatPy

```shell
python build.py -h                   # Show help and available flags
python build.py -j<number-of-cores>  # Compile tudat and tudatpy
```
This script compiles tudat and tudatpy. It will take some time to execute, but you can speed up the process by using the `-j` flag, and replacing `<number-of-cores>` with the number of cores you want to use.

6. Install

```shell
python install.py -h                 # Show help and available flags
python install.py -e                 # Install in "editable mode"
```
This script installs tudat and tudatpy in your active conda environment. If you don't call it with the `-e` flag, you will have to re-run it every time you modify the source code, so we don't recommend it.

And that's it! The next step shows you what to do if you want to uninstall the libraries.

7. Uninstall

```shell
python uninstall.py -h                # Show help and available flags
python uninstall.py                   # Uninstall tudat and tudatpy
```
This script will remove tudat and tudatpy from your Conda environment, but it will not delete the build directory.

### Verify your installation

It is a good idea to verify that your installation is working by running the `tudatpy` tests. If you are in the `tudat-bundle` directory, you can do this by running
```shell
pytest
```
If you built tudat with the `--tests` flag (which is turned off by default), you can also run the tudat tests as follows
```shell
cd build/tudat
ctest
```
If all the tests are passing, your libraries are ready to use! Otherwise, feel free to reach us by asking a question on [installation support](https://github.com/orgs/tudat-team/discussions/categories/installation).

## Alternative build: CLion
> [!NOTE]
> - [**Windows Users âˆ© CLion Users**] In CLion, be sure to set WSL as your Toolchain
>  in `File>Settings>Build, Execution, Deployment>Toolchains`.
>
> - [**CLion Users**] In CLion, the convention to set CMake arguments
>  is to add them to `File>Settings>Build, Execution, Deployment>CMake Options`.

5. Open CLion, create a new project from `File > New Project` and select the directory that has been cloned under bullet
   point 1 (named `tudat-bundle`).

> [!NOTE]
> To avoid issues with CLion, the directory of the project should correspond exactly to the cloned directory named  `tudat-bundle`.


6. Create a build profile in `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > CMake`.
> [!NOTE]
> The CMake configuration option `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` will be determined by the the build profile's `Build type` entry.
> A `Release` configuration will suppress a significant amount of harmless warnings during compilation. Currently,
> with the move to a later version of boost, some warnings have cropped up that have either not been fixed in the
> source code, or have not been suppressed via `tudat/cmake_modules/compiler.cmake`.

7. Add the CMake configuration to the `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > CMake > CMake options` text box:

```
-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<CONDA_PREFIX>
-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=14
-DBoost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE=ON
```

The `CONDA_PREFIX` may be determined by activating the environment installed in step 4 and printing its value:
````
conda activate tudat-bundle && echo $CONDA_PREFIX
````

The following line can also be edited if you wish to build tudatpy with its debug info (switching from `Release` to `RelWithDebInfo`; note that `Debug` is also available):
````
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
````

[**Optional**] Add `-j<n>` to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > CMake > Build options` to use multiple
processors. It is likely that if you use all of your processors, your build will freeze your PC indefinitely. It is
recommended to start at `-j2` and work your way up with further builds, ensuring **no unsaved work** in the background.

8. In the source tree on the left, right click the top level `CMakeLists.txt` then `Load/Reload CMake Project`.

9. `Build > Build Project`

## Alternative build: VSCode

This section explains how to configure VSCode with CMake presets to build and manage your `tudat` build. The configuration supports parallel builds, switching between Debug and Release modes, enabling/disabling tests, and cleaning build directories.

### Requirements

1. **VSCode** with the following extensions:
   - [CMake Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools)
   - [C++ Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)

2. **CMake** installed on your system (minimum version 3.19).

3. **Conda** environment for managing dependencies.

4. **Make/Ninja** installed based on your operating system for build generation.

### Steps to Configure VSCode

1. **Create the `CMakePresets.json` file** in the root directory of your project. Use the following template with necessary adjustments:

```json
{
  "version": 3,
  "cmakeMinimumRequired": {
    "major": 3,
    "minor": 19,
    "patch": 0
  },
  "configurePresets": [
    {
      "name": "default",
      "hidden": false,
      "generator": "Unix Makefiles", // Set this based on the OS: "Unix Makefiles" for Linux/macOS, "Ninja" or "Visual Studio" for Windows
      "binaryDir": "${sourceDir}/build", // Build directory
      "cacheVariables": {
        "CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH": "/path/to/your/conda/environment", // <--- CHANGE THIS: Set this to your conda environment or other toolchain path
        "CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX": "/path/to/your/conda/environment", // <--- CHANGE THIS
        "CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD": "14", // The C++ standard to use
        "Boost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE": "ON", // Ensures that the system-installed Boost CMake files are not used
        "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE": "Release", // Default to Release build
        "TUDAT_BUILD_TESTS": "ON" // Set to ON to build tests by default
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "debug",
      "inherits": "default",
      "description": "Debug build configuration",
      "cacheVariables": {
        "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE": "Debug" // Use Debug mode for this preset
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "no-tests",
      "inherits": "default",
      "description": "Build without tests",
      "cacheVariables": {
        "TUDAT_BUILD_TESTS": "OFF" // Disable test building in this preset
      }
    }
  ],
  "buildPresets": [
    {
      "name": "default",
      "hidden": false,
      "configurePreset": "default", // Use the default configuration preset
      "jobs": 8, //<--- CHANGE THIS: Parallel build with N cores
      "targets": [
        "all" // Build the default target (usually all)
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "debug-build",
      "configurePreset": "debug", // Use the debug configuration preset
      "jobs": 8, //<--- CHANGE THIS: Parallel build with N cores
      "targets": [
        "all"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "build-no-tests",
      "configurePreset": "no-tests", // Use the no-tests configuration preset
      "jobs": 8, //<--- CHANGE THIS: Parallel build with N cores
      "targets": [
        "all"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "clean",
      "configurePreset": "default",
      "jobs": 8, //<--- CHANGE THIS: Parallel build with N cores
      "targets": [
        "clean" // Run the clean target
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Comments on the Configuration

- **CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH**: Set the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` and `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` to your `tudat-bundle` environment. This is critical to ensure CMake can find the necessary libraries and dependencies.

- **Generator**: Depending on your OS, the generator should be:
  - `"Unix Makefiles"` for **macOS** and **Linux**.
  - `"Ninja"` for **Windows** (if Ninja is installed).
  - `"Visual Studio"` for **Windows** if using Visual Studio.

- **Parallel Jobs**: The `jobs` key is used to specify the number of jobs for parallel builds. Set the number of cores to be used for the build.

- **Presets**:
  - `default`: Builds the project in Release mode with tests.
  - `debug`: Builds the project in Debug mode.
  - `no-tests`: Builds the project without tests.
  - `clean`: Cleans the build directory.

### How to Use Presets in VSCode

1. **Open VSCode** in your project directory.

2. Open the Command Palette (`F1` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run the command `CMake: Select Configure Preset`.

3. Choose one of the configure presets:
   - `default`: for Release builds.
   - `debug`: for Debug builds.
   - `no-tests`: to skip building tests.

4. Once configured, run the command `CMake: Select Build Preset` from the Command Palette, and choose one of the build presets:
   - `default`: to build the project.
   - `debug-build`: to build in Debug mode.
   - `build-no-tests`: to build without tests.
   - `clean`: to clean the build directory.

5. To start the build, run `CMake: Build` from the Command Palette or use the build button in the status bar.

### Troubleshooting

- **CMake Errors**: If CMake cannot find dependencies, check that the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` and `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` are set correctly in the `CMakePresets.json` file.
- **Wrong Generator**: If the build fails due to an unsupported generator, change the `"generator"` field in the preset to match your OS and toolchain.

<!--
The following line can also be edited if you wish to build tudatpy with its debug info (switching from `Release` to `RelWithDebInfo`; note that `Debug` is also available):
````
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
````

As building can take a while, you can build using multiple processors by appending by modifying your [build.sh](build.sh) script. For instance, you can modify the existing line defining the ``NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS`` to the following, to use 2 threads for compilation. Note that a single thread may use up to 4 GB of RAM, and using too many parallel threads will make the compilation run out of RAM and terminate.
````
NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS=${number_of_processors:-2}
````

6. Run the [build.sh](build.sh) script.

````
bash build.sh
```` -->



## Setting up WSL for tudat development

The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a tool that allows you to set up an Ubuntu terminal in a Windows computer. This will be the terminal you will use to interact with `tudat` and `tudatpy`, and the one in which Conda, CMake, git... should be installed. Here, you can find some tips about WSL for tudat development.

- Follow the [Microsoft Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to set up WSL.
- Anaconda/Miniconda, Python and any other dependencies you require while **executing code** from the `tudat-bundle`, must be installed in its Linux version via the Ubuntu terminal. This does not apply to PyCharm/CLion however, which can be configured to compile and/or run Python code through the WSL.
- Note that, to access files and folders of WSL directly in Windows explorer, one can type `\\wsl$` or `Linux` in the Windows explorer access bar, then press enter.
- At the opposite, please follow [this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-mount-disk) to access Windows file trough WSL.
- [This guide from Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment) contains more information on the possibilities given trough WSL.
- In the Ubuntu terminal environment under WSL, run the command `sudo apt-get install build-essential` to install the necessary compilation tools

- Conda: How to install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)?
- CMake: You can use `conda install cmake`, or any alternative method.


## C++ Code Formatting with Clang-Format
`tudat-bundle` uses `clang-format` to enforce a consistent code style. The configuration file is located in the root of the repository as `.clang-format`.

### Prerequisites

Ensure `clang-format` is installed. You can check the installation by running:

```bash
clang-format --version
```

If it's not installed, install `clang-format` using a package manager:

- **On Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt install clang-format`
- **On macOS**: `brew install clang-format`
- **On Windows**: Download and install from [LLVM's official site](https://releases.llvm.org/).

### Configuration File

This `.clang-format` file configures formatting settings, including indentation width, brace wrapping, spacing rules, and alignment settings. These settings will ensure your code remains organized, readable, and consistent with `tudat` code style.

### Usage

#### 1. Running Clang-Format on a Single File

To format a single file, run:

```bash
clang-format -i path/to/your/file.cpp
```

The `-i` flag formats the file in place.

#### 2. Running Clang-Format on Multiple Files

To format all `.cpp` and `.h` files in your project directory:

```bash
find path/to/your/project -name '*.cpp' -o -name '*.h' | xargs clang-format -i
```

Alternatively, if you're using an IDE like Visual Studio Code, you can configure it to automatically format on save.

#### 3. Setting Up Automatic Formatting in VSCode

If youâ€™re using Visual Studio Code, you can automate code formatting:

1. Install the **Clang-Format** extension from the marketplace.
2. Open your projectâ€™s **Settings** (File > Preferences > Settings).
3. Search for `Clang-Format` and set the path to your `.clang-format` file.
4. Enable **Format on Save** by setting `"editor.formatOnSave": true` in your `settings.json`.

#### 4. Checking Format Without Applying

To preview formatting changes without modifying files, run:

```bash
clang-format -output-replacements-xml path/to/your/file.cpp
```

This will show XML output if there are any format issues. You can then decide to apply formatting manually.

<!-- ## Use your build
The path of the TudatPy kernel that has been manually compiled needs to be added before importing any `tudatpy.kernel` module.
This can be done with the following two lines, with `<kernel_path>` being similar to `<tudat-bundle_path>/build/tudatpy`:
```
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, <kernel_path>)
``` -->

<!-- ## Notes

- [**All Users**] You can increase the number of cores used to compile `tudat` & `tudatpy` using the `-j<n>`
  build argument, but **be aware** that the current complexity of the libraries can often result in your PC freezing indefinitely. -->
